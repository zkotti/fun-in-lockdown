Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.

## <a name="board-games"></a>Board Games
Board Games are a great way to have fun and spend your time with family and friends!

### Online board games
Below you may find some interesting websites where you can play different board games along with your friends:

* [Among Us](https://www.bluestacks.com/apps/action/among-us-on-pc.html): The game takes place in a space-themed setting, in which players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors. The goal of the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the Impostors' goal is to covertly sabotage and kill the Crewmates before they complete all of their tasks. Players suspected to be Impostors may be eliminated via a plurality vote, which any player may initiate by calling an emergency meeting (except during a crisis) or reporting a dead body. Crewmates win if all Impostors are eliminated or all tasks are completed whereas Impostors win if there is an equal number of Impostors and Crewmates, or if a critical sabotage goes unresolved.
* [Chess](https://www.chess.com/): Probably the most famous strategy game. Chess is a board game between two players on either side of a board called a chess board made up of sixty-four squares. Players take turns moving one of their sixteen pieces. Each player initially has a king, a queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights and eight pawns.

If the other team also doesn’t get the word you get another try. So, this goes on for 3 times till someone gets the password and then the next round starts. It's a really entertaining game to play with your friends. **Pro Tip**: Turn this into a drinking game and you'll maximize the fun!*([download it here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.androidmate.password_game))*

* [Munchkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin_(card_game)): Munchkin is a dedicated deck card game by Steve Jackson Games, written by Steve Jackson and illustrated by John Kovalic. It is a humorous take on role-playing games, based on the concept of munchkins (immature role-players, playing only to "win" by having the most powerful character possible).In Munchkin, all players start at level 1, with the goal of reaching level 10 (or level 20 in Epic Level games). Players primarily progress by killing monsters, and level up every time they kill a monster. However, players can freely use cards against monsters and other players during play, allowing them to either assist or to sabotage others during their turn. Each person's turn begins when they "kick down the door" by drawing a Door Card face-up. A Door Card can be one of the following types: a Monster Card, which the player must engage by fighting or fleeing; a Curse Card, which applies an effect; or an Item Card, Race Card, or Class Card, which the player adds to their hand. If the card drawn is not a Monster Card, the player can either "loot the room" by drawing a face-down door card and adding it to their hand, or "look for trouble" by playing a Monster Card from their hand to fight it.
* [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)): The classical buying and trading properties game.
* [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)): A strategy board game which combines war, debate, diplomacy, conflicts, and luck.

Do not play this game with your best friends, it will be the end of a friendship...  
* [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble): A game in which you use random letters to create words.
* [Stratego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego): A Napoleonic version of capture the flag!
* [Taboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_(game)): The game of forbidden words. In Taboo, your goal is to get your teammate to say the word written on one of the game cards without saying that word or any of the “taboo” words also listed with it.
* [Tichu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tichu): Tichu (also known as Haris) is a multi-genre card game; primarily a shedding game that includes elements of Bridge, Daihinmin, and Poker played between two teams of two players each. Teams work to accumulate points; the first team to reach a predetermined score (usually 1,000 points) is the winner. You can also play online at: [dod.games](https://www.dod.gr/?app=games)

###### Public Domain Books

The public domain consists of all the creative work to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply. Those rights may have expired,been forfeited, expressly waived, or may be inapplicable. So, a public-domain book is a book with no copyright, a book that was created without a license, or a book where its copyrights expired or have been forfeited.

In most countries the term of protection of copyright expires on the first day of January, 70 years after the death of the latest living author. The longest copyright term is in Mexico, which has life plus 100 years for all deaths since July 1928. A notable exception is the United States, where every book and tale published prior to 1926 is in the public domain; American copyrights last for 95 years for books originally published between 1925 and 1978 if the copyright was properly registered and maintained.For example: the works of Jane Austen, Lewis Carroll, Machado de Assis, Olavo Bilac and Edgar Allan Poe are in the public domain worldwide as they all died over 100 years ago.

## <a name="cocktails"></a> Cocktail Adventures!
Let's be honest, Covid-19 pandemic and its several back-to-back lockdowns have been harsh for the most of us. Being in front of a screen for hours, unable to get in physical touch with our beloved ones and having our favorite restaurants and bars closed is an everyday struggle. After all that, the need to pour a glass (or two) of wine before bedtime comes naturally.

So, we are here to just say that we understand and that it's time to level up the game; Cocktail adventure nights! Do you want to advance your bartender skills or feel like a little kid again? Well, as you discover new tasty horizons and mix up your favorite ingredients, the art of mixology will start to unfold and we promise you to enjoy those lockdown days as they are passing by.

### Organize your space.
First things first; Before you start your mixing experiments, you need to set up your working station. There are not many things required for that, just the basic bar essentials and spirits of your preference.  
- Bar tool essentials:
  1. Bar Spoons. You may already have some long-handle teaspoons but if you don't, you can find them [here](https://www.amazon.com/Hiware-Stirring-Stainless-Cocktail-Pattern/dp/B01EL7NAYU/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=bar+spoons&qid=1567433894&s=gateway&sr=8-9).
  2. Bottle opener & corkscrew. We are pretty sure everyone has at least one bottle opener of any kind. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/WHELVE-Mounted-Magnetic-Functional-Upcycled/dp/B07NQRGVTR/ref=sr_1_19_sspa?keywords=wall+mounted+bar+bottle+opener&qid=1567439614&s=gateway&sr=8-19-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExQlU3VFdCSTJUT1E0JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTc3NjgzMVRYV0VQWFJVSjIxWCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDk1MjY2M1FHM0hTV0ZPM0VFVSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) is an extra idea if you are looking for something new.
  3. Cocktail shaker. Maybe the most important thing in a bar. For your homemade cocktails you probably won't need more than one shaker, which you can purchase [here](https://www.amazon.com/Boston-Cocktail-Shaker-Unweighted-Professional/dp/B07QFT835K/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=bar+cocktail+shaker&qid=1567440752&s=gateway&sr=8-7).
  4. Cocktail strainer. If your cocktail shaker doesn’t come with a built-in strainer, you’ll definitely need one of these to create cold ice-free drinks. We suggest something stainless like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Hawthorne-Cocktail-Strainer-Professional-Mixologists/dp/B06WGNF3SX/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=bar+cocktail+strainer&qid=1567441714&s=gateway&sr=8-4).
  5. Cutting board. That's an easy one too. Most kitchens are equipped with a wooden cutting board, but [here](https://www.amazon.com/Cutting-Board-Food-Prep-Restaurantware/dp/B075S5CX16/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=bar+cutting+board&qid=1567433589&s=gateway&sr=8-6) is a fresh suggestion to cut your cocktail garnishes. With a cutting board you provide your bar not only a hygienic and safe surface for cutting, but also you can avoid making a mess to your kitchen.
  6. Ice crusher. It's a must when making cold cocktails. Having an ice crusher is the ideal way to crush ice to the right consistency for your signature cocktails. [This one](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Treats-Iceberg-crusher-white/dp/B087VJ13WB/ref=sr_1_1?_encoding=UTF8&c=ts&dchild=1&keywords=Blenders+%26+Ice+Crushers&qid=1616503456&s=kitchen&sr=1-1&ts_id=289732) is portable and doesn’t take up much room. Alternatively, you can buy crushed ice, however this can increase your budget.
  7. Jigger. It is not as necessary as one might think, because the more cocktails you make the more familiar you become with the liquid doses. However, if you want to get some jiggers as a beginner mixologist or to be a more professional one, then [this set](https://www.amazon.com/CucinaPrime-Cocktail-Jigger-Stainless-Steel/dp/B00VCBM4TQ/ref=sr_1_11?keywords=jigger&qid=1567444723&s=gateway&sr=8-11) is what you are looking for.
  8. Muddler. Your homemade bar requires a muddler,[like this](https://www.amazon.com/Extra-Long-Cocktail-Muddler-Professional/dp/B07DMFH8SF/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=muddler&qid=1567433016&s=gateway&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzRU5SODNEUTJQVThUJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDM0ODMyTzFJVTJXMEVCM0ZSJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA0ODY0MjgzSDVJMUFCNFJZQTExJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) if you want to bring out the aromatics of herbs and spices so that their flavors are released and infused into your cocktails.
  9. Rimmer. If you’re making margaritas and other drinks that require a rimmed glass edge, for a low budget you can always use a plate filled with salt or sugar, but [here](https://www.amazon.com/Greenco-Glass-Rimmer-Margarita-Cocktail/dp/B016YM64JI/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=rimmer+for+bar&qid=1567448578&s=gateway&sr=8-15) is a more professional option.
  10. Proper kind of glasses. Last but not least, your bar will need the specific glasses to pour your creations, like Coupe Glasses, Single & Double Rocks Glasses, Highball & Collins Glasses, Nick & Nora Glasses and of course Shot glasses. Our suggestion is, if you don't have any of these kinds, to purchase just a pair of each and get more as your cocktail adventures proceed.[Here are the types of Cocktail Glasses You Actually Need](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-cocktail-glass-types.html).

- Bar spirit essentials:
  1. Rum: Its sweeter flavor makes it one of the more versatile spirits. It was among the first liquors to be mixed into drinks, so there are some excellent classic rum cocktails to choose from. It is the obvious base for tropical drinks and appears in several warm cocktails.
  2. Whiskey - Bourbon: It mixes well with other liquors to create complex drinks, and it pairs well with many fruits, particularly the darker fruits. Warm drinks are also very popular with whiskey.
  3. Tequila: It has a great flavor profile that mixes well into a variety of cocktails. There are, of course, the margaritas and frozen cocktails in which tequila is mixed with any fruit imaginable. It also makes a perfect base for spicy cocktails and is very popular for party shots.
  4. Brandy: It's popularly featured in several classic cocktails and tends to be used in drinks that include just a few ingredients. However, many modern brandy recipes break this mold and experiment with brandy in some unique flavor combinations.
  5. Gin: Gin's dry profile makes it a perfect candidate for dry (non-sweet) cocktails, including many classics and martinis. It is a nice base for cocktails and pairs well with lighter mixers, fruits and naturally works well with herbs.
  6. Vodka: Its neutral taste makes it the most versatile spirit available today. Vodka cocktails include almost every imaginable flavor profile, from sweet to savory, fruits to herbs, and spices to sparkling mixers.
  7. Dry and Sweet Vermouth: Dry vermouth is famously used to make martinis and is dry and floral. Sweet vermouth is sweet, spiced, and herbal, and is used in cocktails like Manhattans and negronis.
  8. Amaretto: It is very adaptable, mixing with a variety of flavors, from fruits to coffee and cinnamon to ginger. Amaretto is found in creamy cocktails, adds a sweet touch to martinis, and gives a nice depth to fruity highballs.
  9. Campari: It is commonly served with soda water or citrus juice, or with prosecco as a spritz. Campari is an essential ingredient in the classic Negroni cocktail, the Garibaldi, the Americano and the spritz (an aperitif popular in northern Italy).

- Bar Non-Alcoholic Essentials:
  1. Ice! Yeap, you're going to use lots of it, so you better stock your freezer before you get started with your cocktail experiments.
  2. Juices: Most common used are lemon, lime, orange and cranberry/strawberry juice. For more tropical cocktails you may want to have pineapple juice or coconut cream/milk. Of course don't forget tomato juice as it is essential for making Bloody Mary.
  3. Sodas: Club soda, Tonic Water, Ginger Ale, Cola. The list is simple and includes the basics that you are likely to encounter in recipes.
  4. Bitters: It is amazing what a dash or two of bitters can do to the flavor of almost any cocktail. To start, you'll find that aromatic and orange bitters are used most often and a bottle of each can last years.
  5. Simple Syrup: Sugar and water, that's it. This is the best way to sweeten cocktails and it's incredibly simple to make yourself.
  6. Grenadine: That famous red syrup, it's essential for many great drinks. You can buy or make this one yourself.
  7. Garnishes: lime, lemon, orange and any other fruit slices you prefer, cinnamon sticks to add flavor to any cocktail especially warm ones, mint and DO NOT forget to stock salt and sugar (extra tip: try adding brown sugar)

## <a name="coding-projects"></a>Coding Projects

<br/>

<img align="left" width="40" height="40" src="media/icons/python.png">

### **Python**       

<br/>

* Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple python program to test your skills. Try developing it as a player vs computer game in the beginning. Skills used: Learn how to use while loops and if statements

* Build a Twitter Bot

You can make a program that helps you engage your audience while studying or working on other projects! You will have to sign up as a Twitter developer, but don't worry, it is not that difficult.

* Alarm Clock

Creating an alarm clock is a cool way of demonstrating your coding skills. To begin with, create a program that sends a notification at a designated time. Afterwards, you can add functionality, like music or videos.

* Typing Test

Create a python program with a complete GUI, that gives you a random sentence, and tests your typing speed. It is an advanced project but you can learn a lot about design.

* Web Crawler

A web crawler is an automated program script that surfs the internet and stores the content of a particular webpage. You will need to use a multi-thread concept for such a program. You can use Python’s request module to make the crawler bot, or you can use Scrapy. 

* Spin a Yarn

The program first prompts the user to enter a series of inputs. These can be an adjective, a preposition, a proper noun, etc. Once all the inputs are in place, they are placed in a premade story template using concatenation. In the end, the full story is printed out to read some misintended madness!

<img align="left" width="40" height="40" src="media/icons/java.png">


### **Java**

<br/>


* Temperature Converter Tool

This is a simple project to help you practice your Java skills. It just requires the basic mathematic skills that will help you build the logic of the program.
Tip: you can use the javafx package to build the tools interface.

* Percentage Calculator

This is another great project to help you develop your coding skills and it uses basic Java concepts. The user just inserts the value and the calculator returns the matching percentage.
The javafx package will help you build the interface.

* Laboratory Management System

Java Project Idea: The laboratory management system is another exciting beginner level project that is used to provide security of the data of the laboratory. Access permissions for viewing and updating the data are set for each entity. There are three entities in this system.

The Admin maintains database of laboratory and can retrieve data from the database using oracle and solves the technical problems if it occurs by using technologies like Java servlets and JSP using the tomcat server.

The Faculty can post and update marks of students and can provide notices and latest updates related to tasks, like date of task submission, dates of lab examinations. Faculty also generates the report.

Students are the main users of this system. Their attendance is updated whenever they login to the system. The student has only permission to view the notices and updates.

* Stadium Seat Booking System

Java Projects Idea: This is another automated system that can be developed in Java and will be useful to the people for booking their seats in the stadium through the online method. Every detail of the stadium should be mentioned properly including the number of seats, seat availability, price of the seat, category of seats.

Admin will manage all the details related to the stadium and matches that would take place in the stadiums and will have to update each detail. When the user books a seat, he will get a unique seat number.

This application will require a robust database as it would contain the details of all the matches taking place in a particular region.

* Color Hunt Gaming Project

Java Project Idea: Color hunt is an entertaining mind game which consists of letters with different colors arranged randomly on it. In this Java game, we mention a statement of a precise color and letter, which we’re supposed to click in the block box as fast as we can. We need to click on the exact color which has been mentioned and the statement immediately keeps changing.

* I-card generator system

Java Project Idea: As the name suggests, the I-Card Generator System will help in smoothly generating the identity cards for the employees of any organization or for the students and teachers of the educational institutes with great ease.

The admin will add all the relevant details to be shown on the id card like photograph, name, age, department, year of joining, blood group, address, mobile number. And the system will generate the id card based on these details. The system will ensure that only one ID card is generated for a person. This project will prove to be one of the unique and interesting core Java projects to be opted for and to Java expertise in your profile.

### **React**

<br/>

* Realtime Chat App

Real-world examples: Slack, Messenger, Discord, Crisp Chat

All of us use some kind of a realtime chat app in our daily life, you can also experiment with creating a widget within a website so that customers can directly talk to the site owners.

All chat apps allow users to send messages in real-time, to react to messages and to show when a user is online or offline.

> How to build a realtime chat app:
> * Build your project with create-react-app or Next.js
> * Use a service like Firebase or GraphQL subscriptions for messages
> * Add reactions to message with emoji with the npm package emoji-mart
> * Deploy to the web using Firebase Tools

* Social media app

It is similar to a chat app, but with a larger community of users and wider functionality. The users can interact in different ways. They can follow one another, add media to share with others, and interact with liking or commenting posts.

> How to build a social media app:
> * Build the frontend with create-react-app and the backend using Node API
> * For a database, use Postgres or MongoDB, alongside an ORM like Prisma or Mongoose
> * Use social authentication using Passport or a simpler service like Auth0
> * Deploy backend to Heroku, frontend to Netlify

* Video Sharing app

Real-world examples: Youtube, TikTok, Snapchat

One of the most broad categories of apps, that can be integrated in a site like Youtube with a browser to search for videos or like a messaging app eg. Snapchat.

> How to build a video sharing app:
> * As you might know by now, use create-react-app and Node
> * Use Cloudinary for image and video uploads to the Cloudinary API
> * Use Postgres or MongoDB
> * Deploy to Heroku, frontend to Netlify

* Music Streaming App

React applications are perfect for streaming video content, as well as music. Music apps have a similar structure to video sharing apps and they may or may not allow the user to upload their own music. You can listen to a song, comment on it, or even purchase it. Try to combine elements of a video sharing service and of an e-commerce app.

### Want to change your diet?

Maybe you can start by choosing one of the five diets that are listed below.

1. Low-carb, whole-food diet
The low-carb, whole-food diet is perfect for people who need to lose weight, optimize health, and lower their risk of disease.
It’s flexible, allowing you to fine-tune your carb intake depending on your goals.
This diet is high in vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, fruits, nuts, and fats but low in starches, sugars, and processed foods.

2. Mediterranean diet
The Mediterranean diet is an excellent diet that has been thoroughly studied. It’s particularly effective for heart disease prevention.
It emphasizes foods that were commonly eaten around the Mediterranean region during the 20th century and earlier.

3. Paleo diet
The paleo diet is a very popular diet that is effective for weight loss and general health improvement. It’s currently the world’s most popular diet.
It centers on unprocessed foods believed to resemble those available to some of humanity’s paleolithic ancestors.

4. Vegan diet
The vegan diet has become increasingly popular in the past decade. It’s linked to a number of health benefits, including weight loss, improved heart health, and better blood sugar control.
The diet is based exclusively on plant foods and eliminates all animal products.

5. Gluten-free diet
The gluten-free diet is essential for people who are intolerant to gluten, a protein that is found in wheat, rye, and barley.
For optimal health, you should focus on whole foods that are naturally gluten-free. Gluten-free junk food is still junk food.
The bottom line

So many diets exist that it can feel overwhelming to simply find a single one to try.
However, it’s important to note that some eating patterns have more scientific backing than others. Whether you’re looking to lose weight or simply boost your overall health, try to find diets that are supported by research.
The five examples listed above are a good place to start.

## <a name="Discover-Space"></a> **Discover Space**

A lockdown can cause a sudden increase in leisure and boredom at the same time. So, why not take advantage of this time to discover many aspects of the world that can cause awe and the feeling of how small and fragile we are in this world, and killing our boredom.

### **What is space?**
Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.

### **Dark Matter and Dark Energy**

Dark matter is an undiscovered yet matter way different from the normal matter or anti-matter, that interact with gravity and doesn't reflect any light, so, as a result, it is, also, invisible and that's why it's called 'Dark' matter.

 Its presence is implied in a variety of astrophysical observations, including gravitational effects, that cannot be explained by accepted theories of gravity, unless more matter is present than can be seen. For this reason, most experts think that dark matter is abundant in the universe and that it has had a strong influence on its structure and evolution.

 Primary evidence for dark matter comes from calculations, showing that many galaxies would fly apart, or that they would not have formed or would not move as they do, if they did not contain a large amount of unseen matter.

### **Big Bang**

<img align="center" width="500" height="400" src="media/images/big_bang.jpg">

Big Bang theory is a cosmology theory, that try to explain from where the universe and the all the matter came from and how they have been created. In particular, the theory mentions that 13.8 billion years ago, a huge explosion, bigger than anything else in history, took place and became the start of the universe creation and the creation of matter.

Much research has been carried out, in order to prove the Big Bang theory true, with the most valuable of them being this of Edwin Hubble, who has found that galaxies are moving apart from one another in a way that fits previous predictions with the help of Hubble telescope.

While the majority of the astronomical community accepts the theory, there are some theorists who have alternative explanations besides the Big Bang — such as eternal inflation or an oscillating universe.

Solar strom is a common phenomenon that the sun vomit's million tons of plasma and radiation in random destinations, known as Coronal Mass Ejections (CME). A simple solar storm doesn't affect the earth, because atmosphere works as a filter to such waves, but if the wave is too big, then the wave will affect the global communication system and all the devices that use electricity will be out of order. Although this effect affects the earth twice in a century, the mechanics know how to protect the system.

   #### How they are created and what are they
   A black hole is an extremely dense astronomical object from which nothing can escape, not even light. When a star explodes in a supernova, a black hole can be left behind. Alternatively, a supermassive star can burn through its fuel quickly and turn into a black hole, no explosion needed.

   According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, nothing can travel faster through space than the speed of light. This means a black hole's event horizon is essentially the point from which nothing can return. The name refers to the impossibility of witnessing any event taking place inside that border, the horizon beyond which one cannot see.

   "The event horizon is the ultimate prison wall — one can get in but never get out," Avi Loeb, chair of astronomy at Harvard University, told Space.com.

   Actually the size of a black hole has no possible limit (although scientists support that it can't exist a black hole with 50 bln times the mass of our sun). The more matter it swallows, the bigger it can get. The easiest way for a black hole to grow is by swallow another black hole. In result, a new black hole will be created with both their masses and with unbelievable  gravitational power. In order to understand this better, in the above photo the dat in the center of the black hole, is how big is our solar system in front of this supermassive black hole..

   #### **Travel inside a Black Hole & Wormholes**

   The most obvious thing that everyone would imagine that might happen inside a black hole is complete destruction. Actually, Einstein with the relativity theory changed completely the way that we perceive black holes. If matter is capable of bending the time and space, then the black hole, which is the most amount of matter that can be located in a single spot, is doing the biggest den in spacetime. Therefore, if spacetime dimension is like a paper that is folded, the black hole is like a tube that unites the two surfaces. By entering a black hole, you will travel to another location of the universe, where you will be spit out from a white hole, like a detour. Although, neither white hole nor wormhole have been found, they exist only in theory.

   When a massive star in a distant galaxy collapses, forming a black hole, two giant jets of light-emitting plasma shoot from its core. These extremely bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions in the universe, and when a jet points towards Earth, the afterglow can be detected from ground and space-borne telescopes. Material does not simply catapult from an exploding star, it accelerates to ultra-high speeds along the narrow beam of the gamma-ray jet, leaving astrophysics puzzled over the power source driving these extraordinary explosions.

### Neutron Stars

<img align="center" width="300" height="300" src="media/images/neutron_star.jpeg">

Source: [https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/814141/view/neutron-star-artwork](https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/814141/view/neutron-star-artwork)

When the core of a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse at the end of its life, protons and electrons are literally scrunched together, leaving behind one of nature's most wondrous creations: a neutron star. Neutron stars cram roughly 1.3 to 2.5 solar masses into a city-sized sphere perhaps 20 kilometers (12 miles) across. Matter is packed so tightly that a sugar-cube-sized amount of material would weigh more than 1 billion tons, about the same as Mount Everest!

Most known neutron stars belong to a subclass known as pulsars. These relatively young objects rotate extremely rapidly, with some spinning faster than a kitchen blender. They beam radio waves in narrow cones, which periodically sweep across Earth like lighthouse beacons. But as GLAST Project Scientist Steve Ritz of NASA Goddard points out, "With magnetic fields trillions of times stronger than Earth's, pulsar magnetic fields are high-energy particle accelerators." The magnetospheres of some pulsars, accelerate particles to such high energies that they are relatively bright gamma-ray sources.

## <a name="conspiracies"></a>Down the rabbit hole


##### Below, lies a list of conspiracy theories that are notable. Feel free to further investigate, you can find further information and videos on Youtube and Google. Some could be and turn out to be true, but most of these conspiracies seem impossible to believe, but it is still very interesting, to analyze why some groups of people decide to not only follow these beliefs but also promote them.

* __MKUltra__

Genuine American research in the 1950s and 1960s into drug-induced interrogation and mind-control techniques were followed by many conspiracy theories(eg. Project Monarch), especially following CIA Director Richard Helm's 1973 order to destroy anything related to the project. One of these theories, is the allegation that the mass fatality at Jonestown in 1978 was connected to an MKUltra experiment.

The intent of the project was to study “the use of biological and chemical materials in altering human behavior,” according to the official testimony of CIA director Stansfield Turner in 1977.

Under MKUltra, the CIA gave itself the authority to research how drugs could: “promote the intoxicating effects of alcohol;” “render the induction of hypnosis easier;” “enhance the ability of individuals to withstand privation, torture and coercion;” produce amnesia, shock and confusion; and much more. Many of these questions were investigated using unwitting test subjects, like drug-addicted prisoners, marginalized sex workers and terminal cancer patients–”people who could not fight back,” in the words of Sidney Gottlieb, the chemist who introduced LSD to the CIA.

* __Flat Earth__

Flat Earth theory first emerged in 19th-century England, despite the Earth's spherical nature having been known since at least the time of Pythagoras. Lately, it has been promoted by American software consultant Mark Sargent through the use of YouTube videos. Flat-earther conspiracy theorists believe that planet Earth is not a sphere, and that evidence has been faked to hide the fact that is instead a disc, or a single infinite plane. The conspiracy often implicates NASA. Other claims include that GPS devices are rigged to make aircraft pilots wrongly believe they are flying around a globe.

* __Weather and earthquake control projects__

Many theories pertain to real or alleged weather-controlling projects. Theories include the debunked assertion that HAARP, a radio-technology research program funded by the US government, is a secret weather-controlling system. Some theorists blamed HAARP for 2005's Hurricane Katrina. HAARP has also been suggested to have somehow caused earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the 2013 Saravan earthquake or the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Some HAARP-related claims refer to mind-control technology.

* __Area 51__

The famous Area 51 in the Nevada desert is a military installation at the Nelli's Military Operations Area. But the base quickly became known as the most secretive military site in the world because it does not exist on any map or government website, leading many to craft conspiracy theories.

Some believe Area 51 is researching and experimenting on aliens and their spacecraft. More specifically, people think they are studying a crash that happened near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. Others theorize that the moon landing was staged at Area 51.

The government has said the facility is used to test experimental aircraft for the military.

* __QAnon__

QAnon is a baseless far-right conspiracy theory that claims President Donald Trump is secretly fighting a "deep state" cabal of satanic pedophiles and cannibals.

The conspiracy theory dates back to 2017 when a supposed high-level government official posted details of the inner workings of the government on the anonymous messaging board 4chan. The person identified themselves simply as "Q." From there, the far-right group of people known as QAnon was born.

While QAnon started as a niche online forum, it has turned into a mainstream belief system for some conservatives, according to The Washington Post.

However, the claims within the conspiracy theories are not supported by evidence.

<img src="media/images/qanon.jpeg" alt="Quarantine Activities"/>

* __Alaska mind control__

In the mountains of Alaska, you can find the High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program that helps scientists study the farthest distances of the atmosphere. The facility sits on 33 acres of land and has over 180 antennas. The antennas have collected data about the aurora borealis, radio waves, and other atmospheric occurrences.

But some think the antennas are an experimental weapon that can control people's minds, according to the Smithsonian. Others believe it caused the Columbia space shuttle to destruct in 2003. In 2016, however, the facility held an open house so the public could see that they were not up to anything dangerous.



* __Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370__

The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in southeast Asia in March 2014 has prompted many
theories. One theory suggests that this plane was hidden away and reintroduced as Flight MH17 later the same
year in order to be shot down over Ukraine for political purposes. Prolific American conspiracy theorist James
H. Fetzer has placed responsibility for the disappearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

* __Chemtrails__

Also known as SLAP (Secret Large-scale Atmospheric Program), this
theory alleges that water condensation trails ("contrails") from aircraft
consist of chemical or biological agents, or contain a supposedly toxic
mix of aluminum, strontium and barium, under secret government
policies. An estimated 17% of people globally believe the theory to be
true or partly true. In 2016, the Carnegie Institution for Science published
the first-ever peer-reviewed study of the chemtrail theory; 76 out of 77
participating atmospheric chemists and geochemists stated that they had
seen no evidence to support the chemtrail theory, or stated that chemtrail
theorists rely on poor sampling.

## <a name="drinking-games"></a>Drinking Games
Drinking games offer the opportunity to come closer with your friends and have a great time **(Drink responsibly).**
* **Flip cup:** This is a team game, where two opposing groups stand on opposite sides of a table or counter, with a full cup in front of each player.
The games begin, and the first players in line race to down their drinks, and then place their empty cups upside down on the edge of the surface. They then have to successfully flip their cups the right way up – not so easy once you've had a few – at which point the next player in line has to do the same. It's a relay, so the first team to get to the end wins!\
*What you need: Large plastic cups(can also be used for [beerpong](#beerpong))*
* **Drunk Jenga:** Buy a jenga set (there are loads of cheap ones on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Jenga-A2120EU4-Classic-Game/dp/B00ABA0ZOA?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1&psc=1)), and write a different rule on the top of each wooden block. Things like 'drink two fingers of your drink 'or 'have a shot'. The more you play, the drunker you'll get, and the more clumsy your game will be.\
*What you need: A jenga set.*
* **Back to back:** Two people in your group stand back to back, drinks in hand. The rest of the group ask them a 'Who's the most likely to....' question, and which ever member thinks they're the most likely to, drinks. If one of them drinks, you ask the next question. If they both drink, they both have to drink again. If neither of them drink, they also both have to drink again.\
*What you need: Only your drinks.*
*  **Beerpong:**<a name="beerpong"></a> Beerpong is an all-around crowd pleaser, because it’s easy to follow, however difficult to master. To play this team drinking game lay out two sets of cups forming a pyramid on both ends of the table, gather a ping pong ball and fill the cups with your drink of choice. The teams then take it in turns to throw the ball into the other team’s cups. If you get the ping pong ball into your opponent’s cup, they have to drink its contents.\
*What you need: Large cups and a pingpong ball(maybe more than one).*
* **Ring of Fire:** This is an exciting drinking game that is played using playing cards. The player must drink and pass round the drinks based on the card drawn. [Each card has a rule that is established before the start of the game](https://ringoffirerules.com/). Every player picks a card and does what the card represents, and it can be anything from choosing someone to take a drink to start a game of categories. When a player draws a king, he pours a quarter of what he is drinking into the middle cup. The game comes to an end when the last king is drawn. The player who draws the last King has to drink the concoction in the King’s cup to the last drop.\
*What you need: A deck of cards.*
* **Never Have I Ever:** This is an awesome drinking game to get to know your drinking partners better. Everyone needs a drink and their memory to be sharp. Players take turns calling experiences they have never had. Anyone that has had the called experience has to take a sip of their drink. Be careful though! Crazy people will probably get drunk quickly while the shier ones stay sober.\
*What you need: Your drinks and a good mood.*
* **Impostor:** Fill all the shot glasses with water and just one with vodka. Then, place the glasses on a circular rotating surface and gather around it. As the surface rotates close your eyes in order to forget the position of the vodka glass. When the surface stops spinning, players begin to drink the shot glass in front of them in a row. When all the players have had their shot, you start voting who is the impostor (the one with the vodka shot). If the majority votes for the impostor, he drinks two shots, otherwise all the other players, except the impostor, drink one shot. If no one votes for the impostor you have to drink two shots instead of one.\
*What you need: A circular rotating surface and shot glasses.*
* **Buzz:** Buzz is one of the easiest drinking games, in which each player starts counting aloud, except a number (e.g 7) and its multiples, in which case, you say buzz. If you don't, you drink. Very simple!
*What you need: Only drinks.*
* **Most Likely:** This is a quick and funny game. The group sits in a circle and asks a 'most likely' question. For example, "Who would be most likely to sleep on the train?" After counting to three, everyone points at a person who they think are most likely to do so. The person who has the maximum number of fingers pointed at them, drinks as many drinks.
*What you need: Your drinks and a good mood.*

## <a name="facetime"></a>Video call your long-distance friends
Do you remember the nights when you used to hang out for hours with your friends? Since that is not possible any more you can use the following software to replicate the group feeling:
- Skype
- FaceTime
- Microsoft Teams
- Zoom
- Discord
- Or check out these [open source alternatives](https://opensource.com/alternatives/skype)

Virtual Activities:
- Sing karaoke

This is pretty much self-explanatory. Pick a song, find its karaoke version on YouTube and sing along! Tip: make sure everyone else's microphones are mute.

- Disguised party

This can go in two ways. You can discuss with the group the theme of disguise for your next group call and everyone dresses accordingly OR each person picks their costume individually. It feels just like Halloween! How fun!

- PowerPoint party

Essentially, everyone picks a topic near and dear to their heart —the more niche, the better— and prepare a five-minute PowerPoint presentation on it. Here's some fun and interesting ideas: Drunk history, The best [whatever] of all time, Ranking and rating my exes, How HSM changed my life

- Movie/series night

Watch a movie or a series with your group of friends without leaving your home, just by screen sharing in a video call or using streaming platforms like Netflix Party. Plus, you can comment on it in chat without disturbing others.

- Play an online game

Who says you have to be in the same space to have fun? Gather your friends and prepare for the best game night ever! There are a lot of different virtual games to choose from, but you should always check the number of players every game allows. No one should be left behind! You can find a list of virtual board games [here](#board-games).

## <a name="pet"></a>Find your pet friend
Dog or cat? A question that concerns many people!
lockdown is a good chance to buy or better to adopt a new pet, dog or cat, and spend quality time with it.
In order to show your pet your love and care, there are some specific things you can do.

* __Exercise your pet__

Exercise is a vital part of enriching your pets’ lives. Walking, running, playing fetch or tug, and learning agility or flyball are all great ways to keep your dog physically fit. For cats, try interactive play with wand toys or balls. Some cats can be taught to enjoy walks outdoors wearing a harness and leash. Many of these activities have the added benefit of exercising humans, too.

* __Visit the vet for a checkup__

Let’s face it. Few of us like going to the doctor, and our pets are no different. But you can teach your pets to tolerate going to the vet by doling out delicious treats that make the experience more enjoyable. Many clinics will allow you to simply come and visit, so that later on when an appointment is necessary, your pet will have a more positive association with medical care.

* __Healthy food__

Just like humans, pets thrive when they have a healthy diet. A healthy and balanced diet is essential for a healthy and happy pet. Not only will it provide your pet with enough energy for his day to day activities, but it is also vital for proper brain function.

* __Training__

Are you ready to start training your pet? Proper training and socialization are among your pet's basic needs. It's important to start training your pet as soon as possible.At first, pet training can seem pretty overwhelming, especially if this is your first pet. The truth is that training your pet is a very big project. If you take it step by step(watching videos on youtube), you will find the task to be far less daunting.

## <a name="mum"></a>Mums helper with the children

During the lockdown, life can be hard. Especially for mums where they have to deal with super active kids inside the house. This topic is related to help mums to survive and find activities for kid throught the lockdown.

### Learn to draw
Drawing is a really good exercise to exploit kids fantasy and keep them busy , while mum has to cover other responsibilities as work,cook etc. A really good Youtube-series  is the "Draw with Rob" , where Rob chooses a character every week, such as an alien or a dragon and demonstrates how to draw it. You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBpgrJijMpk_pyp9uTbxLdg)  
### Try a Lego challenges
The lego challenge is a printable calendar containing theme tasks for every of the month. Kids can let their imagination run wild and create different structures as a hospital or a luna Park. If they break the 30-days challenge, dont be afraid, you can always  add one more day. You can find more details [here](https://www.freehomeschooldeals.com/free-printable-30-day-lego-challenge-instant-download/).
### Make origami animals
Keeping kids happy and entertained doesnt have to be costly. A piece of paper is enough to bring their favourite animals to lif in origami form. Kids can try to create a bat, fishes,Butterflies etc. Bonus points if they colour them in afterwards. Check it [here](https://www.origamiway.com/origami-animals.shtml).
### Try creative writing
All you need again is a paper and a pen. Spend some time brainstorming characters, settings, and plot ideas with your child. Once they've written their masterpiece , help them create a fairytale or an ebook.
They can add a lot of different things , like images and videos. Find more about this [here](https://bookcreator.com/features/)
### Do a science experiment
That maybe seems a bit risky, but you dont need a science lab to experiment at home. You can try create a baking soda volcano, or turn a potato into a battery. Alternatively, you can mummify a hotdog or create a tornado in a bottle. Find more [here](https://www.weareteachers.com/easy-science-experiments/).
### Learn to dance
Bring the party to your living room with Kidz Bop or Zouzounia , a YouTube channel packed with dance-along videos and step-by-step tutorials. The dances are performed by kids, for kids – and often to chart hits, so they’re likely to know the words already. Find KIDZ BOP UK [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMXYJDvYOAhpaDZ4QRuqVA) and zouzounia [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/ZouzouniaTV)

### Musical Instruments
You are never actually too old to learn to play an instrument you have always liked. It is a perfect break from your laptop's screen.

#### Guitar

Photo owned by [ro.ieftin2021.com](https://ro.ieftin2021.com/category?name=guitarr)

You will get surprised from how easily you can produce nice sounds. All you need to begin is:
* a [tuning app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ovelin.guitartuna&hl=en&gl=US)
* a set of strings
* a footstool (recommended for classical guitar)
* and of course the guitar

You can either teach yourself with a huge collection of online tutorials and tabs or find a teacher and have online lessons. You can check out [Kurt Berg's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOSmaT73sJrjOmf6PHjxVAQ) YouTube channel for easy beginner tutorials. [Sky Guitar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDlfXUX_wYgyfiXbfQh96Eg) also has a good deal of classical guitar tutorials for different levels.

There are 3 major guitar types:

* *Nylon acoustic (classical):* It produces a mellow sound and it's ideal for beginners, as the strings are easy to pick and it is lightweight and cheap. However, it has wider fretboard.
* *Steel string acoustic:* The strings produce a brighter tone and they are ideal for strumming. However, building calluses can be really painful for beginners.
* *Electric:* You will need at least an amp as the sound is produced from electric signals. It also uses steel strings and it is a bit heavier. Nonetheless, it is great for creativity with many technics and effects.

## <a name="outdoor_activities"></a>Outdoor Activities with Friends

It's corona time for sure but that doesn't mean you can't spend quality time with your friends outside.

Get two friends who you live close to and arrange a fun activity to do together. Make sure you respect the COVID-19 measures and stay safe.

* __Hoops__

   Remember when as kids we used to run around all the time and actually played games like basketball, volleyball and football?

   Going for hoops with a friend or two will get your spirits up (without tiring you much) and definitely make you feel nostalgic of your childhood.

* __Cycling__

   Spring is officially here and days are getting longer and longer. Enjoy the beautiful golden hour with a friend and a bike. You can explore every street of your neighborhood and even go further than that.

* __Roller Skating__

   Similar to cycling but a bit more fun, maybe. Even if you can't balance properly, you and your friend will surely have lots of laughs with your falls.

* __Jogging__

   If you'd like to exercise but can't find the motivation to do so, try with a friend. Go jogging together at a slow pace and watch each other getting fitter and fitter everyday.

* __Setting goals__

   Have a chat with your friend and see what you'd like to have achieved in the next year. Set common goals and discuss your progress every week. Try to motivate each other.

   This guide offers many suggestions for what those goals could be about.

## <a name="past"></a>Take a look at the past

Everyone has made his own journey leading him to where he is now. But how did you come here? What is your story? What remarkable memories have you forgotten because of the high speed routine that you are leading nowadays?

The lockdown period is a great opportunity for you and your closest people to take a look at the past. You will be surprised of the things that you have forgotten along the way and the way things used to be. What a better way to spend some quality time with your family, than to sit together and reminisce by watching photos and old videos together. This material usually sparks storytelling times that can be most amusing and sometimes even didactic!

Here are some ways to visit the past:
* Ask your parents to find old photo galleries or video tapes. For example, you could find yourself making your first baby steps in there!
* Gather all the photos saved digitally, like the ones in your phone, tablet, pc etc. Trust me, you will be surprised by the volume of neglected memories stored in there.
* Go through all the media shared between you and your friends on the messenger app. You can see how to do that [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/566167593908940).
* Ask your relatives to tell you a story from their past. They will deifinitely have some funny or exciting story to tell you and you will end up learning exciting stuff about them!

* Reality TV Shows:

  * Survivor
  * Battle of the couples

* Fast food
* Recommended youtube videos
* Too much time on social media
* Arguing about COVID and taking things way too personally (everyone is in the same situation)

## <a name="writing"></a> Writing
Writing is a skill that I consider to be underestimated. Written communication is everywhere around us; in emails, articles or even in remote work where slack messages are the default form of communication.
There are many types of content produced by writing, like for example:
- Novels
- Short stories
- Academic papers
- Personal journals: Here are some journaling prompts to help your reflection journey:
	- What are the 3 biggest lessons you've learned over the last year?
	- Write down 10 things no one knows about you.
	- Close your eyes and take yourself on your favorite walk. What do you observe?
	- What is a resolution you made in January that you have let slip? How can you pick it back up?
	- What gives you hope for the rest of this year? Why is 2021 a good one?
	- What are your 10 favorite things about yourself?
	- Look around your room. What are you grateful for today in the ordinary?
- Technology documentations
- Blog posts
- And the list goes on

Writing is most often a solitary activity, except for people who like to write in cafe's. The ongoing lockdown is a great opportunity to start practicing writing. I will kick it off with one important tip that I've found to be helpful whenever I'm writing something for other people to read.

__Editing__ and __Writing__ are not the same thing. Whenever you write something, leave it for a few hours or maybe a few days. And then come back to it as an __editor__ to find ways to make it more captivating and understandable for the readers.

<p align=”left” width=”700”>Being healthy should be part of your overall lifestyle.

+ Living a healthy lifestyle can help prevent chronic diseases and long-term illnesses.

+ Feeling good about yourself and taking care of your health are important for your self-esteem and self-image.

Maintain a healthy lifestyle by doing what is right for your body.
Now is the time to start caring about yourself by eating right and exercising regularly. You need to stop sinking into your couch and become active. The lockdown is your chance to change the things you don't like about your life and yourself. You have more time than ever to learn about physical and mental health and find inner peace.</p>

<p align=”left” width=”700”>We all have different needs according to our workout and diet habits.
Since this section is all about the motivation of the reader we would say that it focuses more on the needs of the inactive rather than the active people.
Workout and diet plans should be decided after consideration of our short term goals. For example a currently inactive person except of gaining stamina and endurance, he might also want to  lose some weight. Or somebody might not be concerned about weight loss and just want to build muscle strength. Or maybe he just wants to create a healthy and balanced lifestyle due to eating disorders.  On that account, different short term goals require different meal and workout plans. Although it is possible even during the lockdown to visit a dietitian there are plenty of applications or websites, free or with a monthly/yearly subscription (probably more accurate) to help you create a plan and stick to it.</p>

Quarantine comes with many challenges regarding your health. It’s hard to maintain a balanced diet when you are home for most of the day, with a reduced social life and not much to do. That can lead to decreased productivity  and a pessimistic attitude to life. That’s why it is important to keep taking care of yourself. Learn to appreciate the value of sleep and don’t forget to go out for a walk or a quick run at least once a day. Create a daily routine that you enjoy to follow and learn to love your body and yourself.

<p align=”left” width=”700”>Create a balanced diet that suits your needs and will eventually help you reach your goal. Follow a weekly workout routine.
Working outside is an option during the lockdown so even though you can't go to the gym, you can still go for a run, get some fresh air and power your Mental Health batteries. Some yoga is always a good workout option to strengthen your body and relax. Depending on your skills there are many workout programmes depending on your current level (beginner to intermediate). Create your plan:

* how many days per week
* what kind of workout each day

There are apps that can help you track your progress and motivate you to keep going

### Types of exercise:

1. CARDIO
There is multiple types of cardiovascular training but two types that should be in your plan for best results are high intensity intervals and long slow distance. The combination of these is important for any training plan.

2. HIGH INTENSITY INTERVALS
 This type of cardio consists of short fast bursts of power followed by a recovery period. The purpose is to spike your heart rate higher than it could be during a normal long run to over train heart rate and body. These types of workouts usually are less than 30 minutes. The primary muscle fibers used during this type of training are Type 2 fast twitch fibers, which use energy called ATP made by the mitochondria in the muscles to perform. This ATP power producer is known as the anaerobic system, and it causes your body to burn fat for 24-48 hours after you finish your training.

3. LONG SLOW DISTANCE
Any cardio performed at a steady heart rate for 30+ minutes is considered long slow distance. The primary muscle type used during this cardio is Type 1 slow twitch fibers which uses primarily oxygen. This type of cardio burns fat during your workout which is why its important to do no less than 30 minutes at a heart rate in the fat burning zone, which is 60-70% of your max heart rate.

4. STRENGTH TRAINING
Strength training in this case is considered resistance training. For something to be called resistance training your body has to resist an added stressor. Think weight lifting. Your body’s job is to resist the weight crushing you to the ground. When you practice resistance training your muscles break down and with proper recovery rebuild stronger than before; hence it gets the name strength training. Strength training is important for bone, muscle and cardiovascular health but its claim to fame when adding it into your training plan is the spike in your body’s metabolism since muscle burns more calories at rest than fat.

5. FLEXIBILITY
This can be broken down in different forms, from yoga to pilates to barre. Flexibility is extremely important because it gives the muscles the ability to move through a full range of motion. When the body is unable to move through its full range of motion, injury is more likely to occur.

So the question is, how much of what should you do? Since all components mentioned above should be in a structured training plan, we have to look at what goals each person has, what fits into their schedule, and to me the biggest thing is how your body recovers.

The biggest thing I see as a trainer is people tend to put more on their plate than their bodies can handle.

At first, this will bring quick results. Those results though are usually not sustainable over the long term. The whole goal of exercise is to break down muscle tissue to rebuild it during rest to make it stronger. Overloading yourself with too many workouts will end up having the opposite of the desired effect since your muscles will never have time to rebuild.

That being said, incorporating all three aspects of fitness (cardio, strength training, and flexibility) can be done in a safe and effective manner if it is properly planned out.

First you need to pick your training goal. Is it to lose weight, gain lean muscle, become more flexible, or maintain your current weight? Whichever goal it is you want to make one type of training your main focus and use the others to supplement.

### Tips to Sleep Better at night:

#### 1. Increase bright light exposure during the day

Your body has a natural time-keeping clock known as your circadian rhythm.

It affects your brain, body, and hormones, helping you stay awake and telling your body when it’s time to sleep.

Natural sunlight or bright light during the day helps keep your circadian rhythm healthy. This improves daytime energy, as well as nighttime sleep quality and duration

#### 2. Reduce blue light exposure in the evening

Exposure to light during the day is beneficial, but nighttime light exposure has the opposite effect.

Again, this is due to its effect on your circadian rhythm, tricking your brain into thinking it’s still daytime. This reduces hormones like melatonin, which help you relax and get deep sleep .

Blue light — which electronic devices like smartphones and computers emit in large amounts — is the worst in this regard.

There are several popular **methods you can use to reduce nighttime blue light exposure**. These include:

- Wear glasses that block blue light (24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).
- Switch on the night light mode on your phone or pc every evening
- Stp watching TV and turn off any bright lights 2 hours before heading to bed.

#### 3. Try to sleep and wake at consistent times
